      "description": "I am thrilled to collaborate with my team on this extraordinary project. Having previously worked with Unity, I am confident that we can elevate this game to remarkable heights! Our vision is to design the game in 3D, offering a basic 2D top-down view, and providing the option to play in both top-down (2D) and first-person (3D) modes. Currently, the game is developed in TypeScript, but we plan to transition to Unity shortly. As soon as the website is complete, we'll be on a roll. ðŸ˜Ž"
