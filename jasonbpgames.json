      "description":"Hi just a quick update. I am working on tha game and I've added image-lazy loading to the website. It displays low-quality photos while loading them, sooo... Anyway I am working on 3D character controller and I am going to buy a program for animation called: \"Smack Studio\". It is easy to make 3D animation for sprites you can check it out if you want. It's just a very cool tool to make 3D animations with 2D sprites. That's all for now stay tuned folks! üêª"

      "description": "I am thrilled to collaborate with my team on this extraordinary project. Having previously worked with Unity, I am confident that we can elevate this game to remarkable heights! Our vision is to design the game in 3D, offering a basic 2D top-down view, and providing the option to play in both top-down (2D) and first-person (3D) modes. Currently, the game is developed in TypeScript, but we plan to transition to Unity shortly. As soon as the website is complete, we'll be on a roll. üòé"
